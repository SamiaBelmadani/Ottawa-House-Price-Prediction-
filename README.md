# Ottawa-House-Price-Prediction-
In this project, we aimed to predict house prices in Ottawa using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, encompassing 14 key predictors related to real estate characteristics in the region. First, we preprocessed the data and then employed the following predictive models: Logistic regression, Random forest and Gradient Boosting. The goal was to create a reliable prediction model for house prices. The predictors included location-based features like latitude, longitude, postal code, and distance from downtown Ottawa. Other significant attributes such as property type, style, year built, bedrooms, bathrooms, parking, garage availability, lot dimensions, walkability score, and listed price are considered in this analysis. The project aimed to assist potential homebuyers in estimating the price of an ideal home that met their specific feature requirements within their budget.
